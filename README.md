#Learning PySpark

Here is a quick project I put together to help others dive into the python api for spark. It includes some info on how to set up spark on your local machine, and gives an example on how spark works by doing a straightforward analysis of the MNIST handwritten digits data set.

Demonstrates the use of pyspark to: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;- configure a spark infrastructure 

&nbsp;&nbsp;- load a data set into working memory

&nbsp;&nbsp;- execute operations in parallel
